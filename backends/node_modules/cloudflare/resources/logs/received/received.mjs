     * The `/received` api route allows customers to retrieve their edge HTTP logs. The
     * basic access pattern is "give me all the logs for zone Z for minute M", where
     * the minute M refers to the time records were received at Cloudflare's central
     * data center. `start` is inclusive, and `end` is exclusive. Because of that, to
     * get all data, at minutely cadence, starting at 10AM, the proper values are:
     * `start=2018-05-20T10:00:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z`, then
     * `start=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:02:00Z` and so on; the overlap
     * will be handled properly.
